What inspires me most about data analysis is the ability to uncover hidden patterns and trends that can have a significant impact on business outcomes. I believe that every data point has a story to tell, and my role is to translate that story into insights that drive innovation and growth.

As a data analyst, I specialize in collecting, processing, and performing statistical analyses on large data sets to provide actionable insights. My skills in Power BI, Google Big Query and Looker Studio enable me to extract, manipulate, and visualize data to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations.
